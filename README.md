OESync 0.1.2

An OpenERP connector for Satchmo


OESync connects Satchmo to OpenERP and synchronizes specific models via XML-RPC.
Besides synchronization of products, categories and addresses, this allows the automatic creation of orders, invoices, and payments in OpenErp. The mapping is fully customizable and can be altered to suit your needs.

In the current version, the synchronization is unidirectional (Satchmo -> OpenERP). The other direction should follow soon, though.
